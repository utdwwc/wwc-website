			<h2>
			Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) is a community of engagement, encouragement, and support for women in cybersecurity. Both WWC and WiCyS promote, celebrate, and support females in technology in our community. UTD WiCyS is a chapter of a national organization that was founded at UTD in 2019 as a subgroup of WWC in order to reach as many women as possible. Our chapter hopes to encourage women to pursue a career in the highly dynamic and expansive field of cybersecurity by offering tools, events, and networking opportunities throughout the academic school year in conjunction with the opportunities already provided by WWC.
